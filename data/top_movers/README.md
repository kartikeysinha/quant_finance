Idea:
Everyday, there are some companies in the stock market that move by a lot. 
While it's hard to predict those moves (and warrents its own research), I
aim to explore what happens to the returns after those big moves. 

Are these big moves caused by short-term investment greed, which then
reverses in the long term? Or do these moves tend to stick?

I try to answer these questions here.
